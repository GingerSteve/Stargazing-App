  m_Text: "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,
    filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole
    with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means
    comfort.\r\n\r\nIt had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green,
    with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped
    hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls,
    and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots
    of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound
    on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The
    Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many little round
    doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs
    for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes
    (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the
    same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand
    side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round
    windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.\r\n\r\nThis
    hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had
    lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered
    them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because
    they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what
    a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is
    a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things
    altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained-well,
    you will see whether he gained anything in the end.\r\n\r\nThe mother of our particular
    hobbit... what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays,
    since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are
    (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded
    Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except
    the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when
    large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants
    which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be at in the stomach; they
    dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their
    feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their
    heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and
    laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day
    when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the
    mother of this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the fabulous Belladonna
    Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits
    who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill.
    It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors
    must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there
    was still something not entirely hobbit-like about them, - and once in a while
    members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared,
    and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as
    respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna
    Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that
    was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with
    her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across
    The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable
    that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second
    edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his
    makeup from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out.
    The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty
    years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father,
    which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down
    immovably.\r\n\r\nBy some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of
    the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still
    numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast
    smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes
    (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of
    what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is
    to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures
    sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion.
    He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his
    friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he
    looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on business of
    his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.\r\n\r\nAll that
    the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a
    tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard
    hung down below his waist, and immense black boots. \"Good morning!\" said Bilbo,
    and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf
    looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim
    of his shady hat. \"What do you mean?\" be said. \"Do you wish me a good morning,
    or mean that it is a good morning whether I want not; or that you feel good this
    morning; or that it is morning to be good on?\"\r\n\r\n\"All of them at once,\"
    said Bilbo. \"And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into
    the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's
    no hurry, we have all the day before us!\" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his
    door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed
    up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Very
    pretty!\" said Gandalf. \"But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning.
    I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's
    very difficult to find anyone.\"\r\n\r\nI should think so - in these parts! We
    are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable
    things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them, said
    our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even
    bigger smoke-ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending
    to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his
    sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning
    on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got
    quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning!\" he said
    at last. \"We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The
    Hill or across The Water.\" By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.\r\n\r\n\"What
    a lot of things you do use Good morning for!\" said Gandalf. \"Now you mean that
    you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not
    at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,
    yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know
    my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf
    means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna
    Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!\" \"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good
    gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond
    studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow
    who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and
    giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not
    the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those!
    Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like
    great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all
    evening!\" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as
    he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. \"Dear me!\" she went
    on. \"Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going
    off into the Blue for mad adventures. Anything from climbing trees to visiting
    Elves - or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be
    quite inter - I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon
    a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.\" \"Where
    else should I be?\" said the wizard. \"All the same I am pleased to find you remember
    something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, land
    that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grand-father Took's sake, and for
    the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I
    beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have! Twice
    now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this
    adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you and profitable too, very likely,
    if you ever get over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry! I don't want any adventures, thank
    you. Not today. Good morning!\r\n\r\nBut please come to tea - any time you like!
    Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow!\r\n\r\nGood-bye!\"\r\n\r\nWith that the hobbit
    turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he
    dared, not to seen rude. Wizards after all are wizards.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth
    did I ask him to tea for!\" he said to him-self, as he went\r\n\r\nto the pantry.
    He had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something
    would do him good after his fright. Gandalf in the meantime was still standing
    outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he stepped up,
    and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit's beautiful
    green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing
    his second cake and beginning to think that he had escape adventures very well.\r\n\r\nThe
    next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very
    well, unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this:\r\n\r\nGandalf
    'a Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind.
    Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and
    then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and
    saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door. \"I am so sorry to keep
    you waiting!\" he was going to say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all.
    It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes
    under his dark-green hood. As soon a the door was opened, he pushed inside, just
    as if he had been expected. He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and \"Dwalin
    at your service!\" he said with a low bow.\r\n\r\n\"Bilbo Baggins at yours!\"
    said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When the silence
    that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: \"I am just about to take tea;
    pray come and have some with me.\" A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly.
    And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your
    hall without a word of explanation?"
